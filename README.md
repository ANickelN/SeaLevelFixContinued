# Sea Level Fix

A mod for Vintage Story that fixes a couple of bugs related to sea level and world height. This addresses the following
bugs:

* https://github.com/anegostudios/VintageStory-Issues/issues/5378
* https://github.com/anegostudios/VintageStory-Issues/issues/5386

Simply stated, at world heights larger than 256 ore deposits that follow sea level generate too low, and the depth a
deposit can be to generate surface ores is not scaled to take into account the higher sea
level.

In addition to fixing those bugs, this mod has configuration options to alter the maximum depth for surface ore
generation and VERY EXPERIMENTAL support for changing the sea level on world generation. Do not alter the sea level
after creating a new world!
